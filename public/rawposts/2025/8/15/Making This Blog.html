<!--How I threw together this mess of a blog--> 
<h2>This Works!</h2>
<p>I finally decided to make a blog just to jot down my thoughts and stuff I've learned.</p>
<p>But instead of actually planning things out and setting up proper infrastructure, I ended up throwing everything together in an all-nighter.</p>
<p>Having gone through the nightmare of deploying sites before (and dealing with all the headaches that come with it), I really wanted to keep this site as lightweight as possible. (I am also very lazy)</p>
<h2>The Requirements</h2>
<p>I gave myself a quick list of requirements to guide my frantic development session.</p>
<ul>
    <li>- A main page</li>
    <li>- A section to show off my projects</li>
    <li>- Some way to view blog posts (with some basic formatting, at least)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm kind of lazy and didn't really want to use/learn a full-blown CMS</p>
<i>All I wanted was something simple to write blog posts.</i>
<br/>
<p>Since I'm already familiar with React and enjoy working with JSX, I figured that'd be the way to go. Now, the question was: what should I use to display and format these blog posts?</p>
<h2>(Maybe) Reinventing the Wheel?</h2>
<p>I initially thought about using Markdown since it's pretty straightforward and widely used for blogs. However, I quickly realized that it took more than 10 minutes to implement, and thus my laziness prevailed.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across MDX. It seemed pretty neat <i>(no XML!!)</i>, but it felt very tailored to the Next.js crowd, and so was kinda too much to integrate.</p>

<p>I definitely didn't want to create a new component for each blog post, and I also wanted to include metadata (like the post's description and date).</p>

<p>Fortunately, Node.js has this super handy tool for running scripts (I mean it's kind of the whole point of it, I just don't use it for that ever).
</p>
<p>So, I figured I could write a simple script that reads through every “raw” HTML file, grabs the creation date, and extracts the metadata from a comment (hacky, but it works).</p>
<pre><code>
files.forEach(file => {
    if (file.endsWith('.html')) {
        const fullPath = path.join(postsDir, file);
        const stats = fs.statSync(fullPath);
        
        const firstLine = getFirstLineOfFile(fullPath);

        metadata.push({
        filename: file,
        title: file.replace('.html', ''),
        date: stats.ctime.toISOString(),
        firstLine: firstLine, 
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, here's the thing: I use Tailwind, and I want my “barebones” HTML to at least look decent. Fortunately, Tailwind has a fantastic tool for this: <b>prose</b>. Essentially (at least, as far as I understand), it's a set of styles that help make vanilla HTML documents look sleek and polished.</p>
<p>And it works!</p>
